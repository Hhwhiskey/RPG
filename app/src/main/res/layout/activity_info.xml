You have only 400 days, one Evon year, before your people are destroyed. The distance is great, over 10,000 leagues. You must leave now and move with great haste. You will need to balance travelling, combat and rest if you intend to make it in one piece. During your travels you may come across enemies, but do your best to make friends. They will be beneficial in your fight against the enemy once you arrive. While in camp, you may purchase weapons and armor from the blacksmith and potions from the Alchemist. You may also rest safely while inside the camp. You can also be healed by the Soothsayers, but it will cost you. Between camps, you will have to rest in the frey. Do your best to avoid being ambushed. Travel no more than 10 leagues a day, so you don't become exhausted. You possess great power, once a day you can channel this power into a heroic ability against your enemies. Make good use of this ability, because once it's gone, you must wait a day until it can be used again. Make it home to your people. Only you can help them now. Once you are ready, begin your quest home... "
